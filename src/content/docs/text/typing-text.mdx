<TypingText />

This code creates a cool text-typing effect where words from an array are displayed one at a time, as if someone is typing them. After typing a word, it erases it, then moves on to the next word in the array, and the cycle repeats. It's like a dynamic and playful way to showcase different words on a webpage, adding a bit of flair to the text display. The speed of typing, erasing, and pauses between actions gives it a rhythmic and engaging feel.


### Steps

1. Initialization:
   Start by initializing essential variables such as textElement, wordList, and currentWordIndex.

  ```html
  <h1 id="typing-text"></h1>
  ```

```css
#typing-text {
  text-align: center;
  /* Remember to add a height to avoid size shifting between writing and erasing words */
  height: 3.625rem; 
}
```

```js
const textElement = document.getElementById("typing-text");
const wordList = ["Cool", "effect", "right?"];
let currentWordIndex = 0;
let textToType = arr[currentWordIndex];
```

2. Typing Parameters:
   Parameters such as typingSpeed, eraseSpeed, and pauseBetween are set to control the speed of typing, erasing, and the pause between the two actions.

```js
const typingSpeed = 100; // Adjust the typing speed (milliseconds per character)
const eraseSpeed = 50; // Adjust the erasing speed (milliseconds per character)
const pauseBetween = 1000; // Adjust the pause between typing and erasing (milliseconds)
```

3. Character Index:
   charIndex is initialized to keep track of the current character being typed or erased within a word.

```js
let charIndex = 0;
```

4. typeText Function:
   This function simulates the typing effect character by character.
   It checks if textElement is available, then appends the next character of the current word to the displayed text.
   charIndex is incremented to move to the next character.
   If the word is not fully typed, a timeout is set to call typeText after the specified typingSpeed.
   If the word is fully typed, a timeout is set to call the eraseText function after the specified pause (pauseBetween).

```js
function typeText() {
  if (!textElement) return;

  textElement.textContent += textToType.charAt(charIndex);
  charIndex++;

  if (charIndex < textToType.length) {
    setTimeout(typeText, typingSpeed);
  } else {
    setTimeout(eraseText, pauseBetween);
  }
}
```

5. eraseText Function:
   This function simulates the erasing effect character by character.
   It checks if textElement is available, then retrieves the current text content.
   If there is text, it erases the last character and sets a timeout to call itself after the specified eraseSpeed.
   If the text is fully erased, it resets charIndex to 0 and updates textToType to the next word in the array.
   A timeout is set to call typeText after the specified pause (pauseBetween).

```js
function eraseText() {
  if (!textElement) return;

  const currentText = textElement.textContent;

  if (currentText && currentText.length > 0) {
    textElement.textContent = currentText.slice(0, -1);
    setTimeout(eraseText, eraseSpeed);
  } else {
    charIndex = 0;

    if (currentWordIndex + 1 < arr.length) {
      currentWordIndex += 1;
    } else {
      currentWordIndex = 0;
    }

    textToType = arr[currentWordIndex];
    setTimeout(typeText, pauseBetween);
  }
}
```

7. Event Listener:
   The window.addEventListener("load", typeText) initiates the typing effect when the window finishes loading.

```js
window.addEventListener("load", typeText);
```

8. Cycle Through Words:
   That's it! The script will go on an infinite loop, watch your words come a go.
