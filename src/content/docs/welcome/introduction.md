Animatio aims to be a cookbook for the most popular animations on web development. We called **recipes** to all step by step guides of a certain animation or effect.

All animation recipes examples use plain CSS and JavaScript with the intention of teaching the basics, if you are using a framework, is up to you to adapt the code you learnt to your necessities.

<!-- This is an open-source project, that means contributions are welcome! If you want to add a recipe for an animation, check out our [Github repo](https://github.com/CarlosViller/animatio) and help us to grow this cookbook! -->
