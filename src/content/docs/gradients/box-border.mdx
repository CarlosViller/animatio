This effect might not be as intuitive as you may think. We can't apply a gradient to a border, but we can have a box with a gradient background and another box with a bit of margin inside that works as our content box. Let's see how to achieve it.

### Steps

1. Create 2 div elements, one inside the other:

```html
<div class="gradient-box">
  <div class="content">Hello world</div>
</div>
```

2. Create a gradient; you can use <a href="https://cssgradient.io/" target="_blank">cssgradient.io</a> for that.

3. Apply the gradient as a background to the container element and add a small padding. This will create a separation between our gradient box and the content box. That way, it would look like a border!

```css
.gradient-box {
  width: 100%;
  border-radius: 8px;
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    215deg,
    rgba(34, 193, 195, 1) 0%,
    rgba(253, 187, 45, 1) 100%
  );
  padding: 3px;
}
```

4. Add a plain color as the background for your content box and style it as you need:

```css
.content {
  border-radius: 8px;
  background-color: black;
  padding: 10px;
}
```
